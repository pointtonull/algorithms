    Difficulty: Hard

    There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 stepsat a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways youcan climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways: * 1, 1, 1, 1 * 2, 1, 1 * 1, 2, 1 * 1, 1, 2 * 2, 2What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climbany number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, youcould climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.
