    This problem was asked by Jane Street.
    Difficulty: Hard

    Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D
    array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there
    is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any
    currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.
    There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.
